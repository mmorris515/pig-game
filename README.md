# Pig game

This project is an online web application allowing two players to face off in the classic dice game, Pig. I pulled the original template for the project from a tutorial built with vanilla javascript by Jonas Schmedtmann [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io/ 'coding heroes') as part of his Udemy course [The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/ 'The Complete Javascript Course').

The idea for this project was to migrate the vanilla JS application, along with some custom updates I added to the original, into React - in order to practice building with React and working off an existing (albeit very simplistic) code base.

With the CSS, HTML, and vanilla Javascript functions already built out, this allows me to focus on how to use React to build in a modular structure and style with React components and translate HTML to JSX.
