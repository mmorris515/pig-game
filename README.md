# Pig web application

This project is a simple web application featuring the classic dice game, Pig. I pulled the original template for the project from a vanilla javascript tutorial by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io/ 'coding heroes') as part of his Udemy course [The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/ 'The Complete Javascript Course')

The idea was to migrate from the original vanilla JS application, along with some custom updates, into React in order to practice building with React and working off an existing code base. It allowed me to practice implementing a modular structure, translating HTML to JSX, and managing CSS styles in React.
