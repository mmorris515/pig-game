# Pig web application

This project is a simple web application featuring the classic dice game, [Pig](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)> 'Pig'). I pulled the original template for the project from a vanilla javascript tutorial by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io/ 'coding heroes') as part of his Udemy course [The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/ 'The Complete Javascript Course')

The idea was to migrate to React from the original vanilla JS application, adding some custom updates along the way. It allowed me to practice building with React from an existing code base, implementing a modular structure, and translating HTML to JSX.
