## Overview

This project is a simple web application featuring the classic dice game, [Pig](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)> 'Pig'), specifically the version known as 'Two-dice Pig.' I pulled the original template for the project from a vanilla javascript tutorial by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io/ 'coding heroes') as part of his Udemy course [The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/ 'The Complete Javascript Course').

I added some UI features like status message updates, a 'wrong move' icon, and some enable-disable functionality on the buttons and input form to improve feedback and overall user experience.

The idea for the project was to practice building an app in React, migrating from Vanilla JS, while adding my own custom updates to the starter code to improve overall user experience.

## Skills used

- HTML
- CSS
- Git
- Javascript
- React
- UI/UX
- Code migration
- Testing & Debugging

## Challenges

As this was my first in depth React project, I faced a few challenges along the way, such as:

- **State management**: controlling state centrally in the App component and lifting state up from child components
- **Form input**: incorporating form input into the app functionality and controlling centrally from the App component, including UI functionality like freezing and un-freezing the form based on the app state.
- **Props**: passing props from parent to child and implementing code in appropriate places within the app.
- **App design**: controlling UI/UX in the visual layer of the App and managing data flow to ensure logical consistency in the game fuctionality.
- **Naming conventions**: managing variable, function, and object names, between multiple layers of the app.

## Takeaway

Overall it was a lot of fun to put my web development, UI/UX, javascript, and React skills into practice! I'm sure there are plenty of improvements I could make, and newer features of React I could have used (like Hooks and Redux) &mdash; and I may still look to implement those in this project at some point &mdash; but it was a valuable experience to start with the base functionality of React.
