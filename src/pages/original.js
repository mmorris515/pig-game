GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, their ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game (or selected final score)
